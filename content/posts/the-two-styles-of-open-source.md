1. Organization owned
   - Useful for letting users try the product out for free
   - Marketing engine. This is a primary channel for leadgen and user
     acquisition. Treat it as such by instrumenting the product and approaching
     users. Take data and add it to the sales funnel so that they can do a
     better job of prospecting.
   - Recruiting funnel
   - Treat as if it was a freemium product, separate via. paid features.
   - No need to invest in community, keep your normal development practices.
   - Don't expect other organizations to help out.
   - Users will be almost exclusively after hours and contribute very small
     pieces of functionality.
   - Partnerships are valid, but optimize for integrations instead of direct
     contributions.
1. Foundation owned
   - Worth it to get other organizations to participate. This is the only
     reasonable model to get organizations to invest a serious amount in the
     development of functionality, where serious amount is more than one or two
     full time engineers.
   - Must aggressively pursue partnerships and make deals to get full time
     contributors from other organizations. This doesn't happen organically and
     is a specific type of business development.
   - There is a high cost to maintaining a community that allows for
     contributions outside your organization. This can be felt from public
     planning meetings, increased latency around communication.
   - Cannot have a "paid" product as the market friction becomes to much from
     the other organizations contributing.
   - A business model around integrations, installation and management.
   - A path to having one winner in a category, it is basically impossible
     otherwise.
   - Real benefits to embracing possible competitors and working together.
