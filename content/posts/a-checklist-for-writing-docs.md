- Provide a clear list of prerequisites for the content
- Split into multiple steps
- For each step, have a way for the user to verify that what they did was
  successful.
- When providing commands, make it possible to cut and paste 100% of the time.
  Don't make the user edit some text to make the command successful. This might
  require minor UX changes to the product, these are good.
- Explain why each step is important and what it is doing to the system.
